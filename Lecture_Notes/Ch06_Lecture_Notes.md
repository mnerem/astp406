- **Telescopes have three main functions for the observer**
    1) Collect light
    2) Magnify an image
    3) Resolve fine details.
    
    The *light collecting power* (aka light grasp) of a telescope is the most important aspect.
      
# Telescope optics: Basic Principles

Refraction and reflections are primary principles behind telescopes

**Grab knight and work out examples of compound lens problem**

# Collecting light
